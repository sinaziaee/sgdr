# Welcome to the new nnU-Net!

This study presents a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in kidney tumor segmentation using deep learning, specifically leveraging multiple local minima during training. Our method generates uncertainty maps without altering the original model architecture or requiring extensive computational resources. We evaluated our approach on the KiTS23 dataset, which effectively identified ambiguous regions and improved segmentation accuracy. The generated uncertainty maps provide critical insights into model confidence, ultimately enhancing the reliability of the segmentation and aiding in more accurate medical diagnoses. Our approach offers a valuable tool for integrating uncertainty quantification into clinical workflows, with potential applications across various medical image segmentation tasks.
